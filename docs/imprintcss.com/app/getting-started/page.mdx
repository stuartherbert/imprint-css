# Getting Started

ImprintCSS runs on any computer which is already setup for NodeJS.

## Installing Dependencies

Before you download a copy of ImprintCSS, you need to have the following installed:

* Node.JS and `npm` (used for building ImprintCSS)
* git (used for downloading ImprintCSS)

Your operating system might already come with some of these.

## Cloning ImprintCSS

Download ImprintCSS by cloning our Github repository:

<pre className="language-bash command-line" data-user="you" data-host="localhost"><code className="language-bash">
git clone https://github.com/stuartherbert/imprint-css.git
</code></pre>

## Installing Tools

Ishi uses [`node-sass`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass). You can install all required tools via `npm`:

<pre className="language-bash command-line" data-user="you" data-host="localhost"><code className="language-bash">
cd css-ishi
npm install
</code></pre>

## Making Ishi Available

To use Ishi in your own Sass projects, add the `--include-path` flag on the command-line:

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-user="you" data-host="localhost"><code class="language-bash">
node_modules/.bin/node-sass --include-path src docs-template/theme.scss > docs-template/assets/theme.css
</code></pre>

## Where To Use Ishi

Ishi doesn't provide any CSS files that you can simply drop into your own project to use. It provides a set of `.scss` files that you can include in your own theme.

Our [page on themes](themes/) has more detail.
