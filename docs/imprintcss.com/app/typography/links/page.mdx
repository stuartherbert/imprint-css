# Links

## Introduction

ImprintCSS blends old-school link styling with the current trend of making links look a little less shouty on the screen.

* links are shown in a lighter blue color if they haven't been visited before
* links that have been visited are shown in a darker blue color
* links are faintly underlined
* links are inherit their font-weight from the containing element
* links are highlighted when the pointer hovers over them, or when they are clicked

This produces [links](links) that look modern but still look like links.

## A Link

Use the standard `<a>` element to create a clickable hyperlink in your content.

### Customize Colors

Link colors are controlled by these variables:

<div className="text-sm">
