# Paragraph Styles

The standard `<p>` element is sized for easy reading on each device group. Each device group has its own font sizes. The line height should accomodate inline `<code>`, <kbd>keyboard</kbd>, <mark>highlighted text</mark> and <samp>output samples</samp> comfortably, without forcing extra spacing just for the lines containing those inline elements.

ImprintCSS provides several semantic classes for the `<p>` element. Use them to make them standout from the bulk of your content on the page.

## Abstract Paragraph

Use `<p class="p--abstract">` to bring an academic look to a summary paragraph. Summary paragraphs are normally found at the top of academically-focused content.

Follow it up with a `<p class="p--keywords">` to draw attention to the key topics covered in our content.

<p className="p--abstract">This white paper looks at the mechanisms available to safeguard sensitive or legally-protected data entrusted to eDaaS.

<p className="p--keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> GDPR, data protection, security, access auditing.</p>
