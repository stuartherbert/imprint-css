# Lists

## Introduction

There isn't much to say about lists. Ishi provides very straight-forward styling for both bullet-point lists (unordered lists) and indexed lists (ordered lists).

## Unordered Lists

Use the `<ul>` element to create an unordered list. These lists have a round bullet point.

### No Nesting

Here is an example of an unordered list:

* first list item
* second list item
* third list item

### Nested List

Here is an example of a nested list:

<ul>
    <li>first list item</li>
    <ul>
        <li>first nested item</li>
        <li>second nested item</li>
        <ul>
            <li>first really nested item</li>
            <li>second really nested item</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>second list item</li>
</ul>

### Unordered Lists With Paragraphs

It's quite common for document-oriented websites to feature paragraphs inside their bullet points. They're a great way to get in-depth points across with clarity.

* This is the first bullet point.

  This is the paragraph that sits below it.

  This is another paragraph that sits below the first bullet point. We can put as many paragraphs as we need below each bullet point, and each one will flow nicely into the next.

* This is the second bullet point.

  This is the paragraph that sits below the second bullet point.

This is a paragraph that comes after the list, to show how the text flows.

## Ordered Lists

Use the `<ol>` element to create an ordered list. These lists are numbered, starting from 1. Sub-lists are indexed alphabetically, starting from 'a'. Sub-sub-lists are indexed using roman numerals, starting from 'i'.

### No Nesting

Here is an example of an ordered list:

1. first list item
1. second list item
1. third list item

### Nested List

Here is an example of a nested list:

1. first list item
   1. first nested item
   1. second nested item
      1. first really nested item
      1. second really nested item
1. second list item

### Very Long Ordered Lists

Although we don't recommend it, you can have lists that contain hundreds of items if you need to. You'll find an example on [a separate page](long-list.html).

## Definition Lists

Use the `<dl>` element to create a definition list (sometimes called a description list).

Ishi styles the list to look like classic dictionaries from the printed age.

<dl>
    <dt>Term 1</dt>
    <dd markdown="1">How often do you use `<dl>` elements in your content? They're handy to include in technical #longform content.</dd>
</dl>
