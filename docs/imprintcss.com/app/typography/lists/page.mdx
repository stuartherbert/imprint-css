# Lists

## Introduction

There isn't much to say about lists. Ishi provides very straight-forward styling for both bullet-point lists (unordered lists) and indexed lists (ordered lists).

## Unordered Lists

Use the `<ul>` element to create an unordered list. These lists have a round bullet point.

### No Nesting

Here is an example of an unordered list:

* first list item
* second list item
* third list item

### Nested List

Here is an example of a nested list:

<ul>
    <li>first list item</li>
    <ul>
        <li>first nested item</li>
        <li>second nested item</li>
        <ul>
            <li>first really nested item</li>
            <li>second really nested item</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>second list item</li>
</ul>

## Ordered Lists

Use the `<ol>` element to create an ordered list. These lists are numbered, starting from 1. Sub-lists are indexed alphabetically, starting from 'a'. Sub-sub-lists are indexed using roman numerals, starting from 'i'.

### No Nesting

Here is an example of an ordered list:

1. first list item
1. second list item
1. third list item

### Nested List

Here is an example of a nested list:

1. first list item
   1. first nested item
   1. second nested item
      1. first really nested item
      1. second really nested item
1. second list item

### Very Long Ordered Lists

Although we don't recommend it, you can have lists that contain hundreds of items if you need to. You'll find an example on [a separate page](long-list.html).

## Definition Lists

Use the `<dl>` element to create a definition list (sometimes called a description list).

Ishi styles the list to look like classic dictionaries from the printed age.

<dl>
    <dt>Term 1</dt>
    <dd markdown="1">How often do you use `<dl>` elements in your content? They're handy to include in technical #longform content.</dd>
</dl>
