# Inspirations

## Introduction

Like programming languages, these days it feels that CSS toolkits borrow to a lesser or greater extent from the ideas of each other. ImprintCSS is no exception, and we want to acknowledge where we have drawn our inspiration from.

## The Heavyweights

<p class="p--leader">Our main sources of inspiration are the acknowledged heavyweights of the Internet styling world.</p>

* The {{ ishi.externallink('bbc-gel') }} gets our top shoutout. Their approach to typography was the inspiration for creating ImprintCSS in the first place. We've also adopted their concept of [device groups](concepts/device-groups.html). We feel that it's a great way to provide great-looking content on any device.

   The {{ ishi.externallink('bbc-news') }} site has also had a major influence. In the current (summer 2015) incarnation, we feel that they've really nailed presentation on mobile and tablet.

* {{ ishi.externallink('bootstrap') }} is the CSS framework that launched a thousand sites (to paraphrase very badly indeed). It will always be remembered for putting easy-to-use markup and styling into the hands of backend developers for the first time.

    Bootstrap was also the other inspiration behind our decision to create our own CSS toolkit. Grids are an incredibly convenient way to layout a web page, but in our experience they're more of a hinderance than a help for supporting different devices. Since Bootstrap was launched, browsers have added support for [flexbox layouts](layouts/index.html), allowing us to get closer to the holy grail of [markup with meaning](structure/index.html).

* {{ ishi.externallink('zurbfoundation') }} is always mentioned as the main alternative to Bootstrap. It was released shortly after Bootstrap, and has arguably gone on to be even more feature-rich than its main rival.

When we're wondering what to call a new feature for Ishi, we always take a look first through both Bootstrap and Foundation to see if they have a comparible feature. We believe it's helpful to adopt the same terminology where it's commonly used.

## Other Shouts

<p class="p--leader">As well as the usual suspects, there other places from the 'net that have played an important role in guiding what we wanted for Ishi.</p>

In no particular order, they include:

* The {{ ishi.externallink('mozilla-devnet') }}. MDN is our go-to reference for all things CSS. They do a great job of making the CSS standards and features understandable.

* What seems like many years ago now, Nathan Smith launched the [960 grid system](http://960.gs/), and showed everyone that we could have table-like layout tools without actually having to use tables.

* We used the [Flexbox in 5 Minutes](http://flexboxin5.com) to get started with [flexbox layouts](layouts/index.html).

* Philip Walton's [Flexbugs](https://github.com/philipwalton/flexbugs) collection has helped us whenever we've run into cross-browser problems with CSS flexbox support.

* The only reason we know that Flexbox even exists is thanks to [Rachel Andrew](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/). Her stories of running your own microbusiness have also been a big encouragement behind setting up Ganbaro Digital.

* Our [contributing guidelines](contributing.html) are based on [the ones used by the Angular JS project](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
