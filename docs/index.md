# Welcome To Imprint CSS

## Introduction

Imprint CSS is a simple responsive CSS toolkit from {{ ishi.externallink('ganbarodigital') }}. It has [clearly defined goals](goals.html). It draws [heavy inspiration](inspirations.html) from existing toolkits and leading content websites.

It is [licensed under the 3-Clause BSD license](license.html). [Contributions](contributions.html) are welcome.

## Why Use Imprint CSS?

The benefits of using Imprint CSS include:

* [beautiful typography](typography/index.html) for easy reading whether you're on the smallest or the largest of devices
* [convenient components](components/index.html) to enhance your content even further and provide nuanced navigation
* [semantic markup](structure/index.html) that describes your content and not your layout, based on HTML5 tags
* [utility classes](utilities/index.html) when you need to be pragmatic
* [multiple layouts](layouts/index.html) that you can easily switch between, based on CSS 3's flexbox (#nogrid!)
* [example themes](themes/index.html) that show you how to use Ishi.

Imprint CSS is a plugin for TailwindCSS v3. You can import it into your own projects, and quickly build on top of it to get the look and feel that you want for your own websites and content.
