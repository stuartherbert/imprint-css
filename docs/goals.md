# Goals

## Introduction

ImprintCSS is a responsive CSS toolkit for building content-oriented websites.

ImprintCSS is designed and developed by {{ ishi.externallink('ganbarodigital') }}. We write technical reports, documentation, and training material for our clients. We also build landing pages and marketing sites for our products and services. The applications that we build are document-oriented.

ImprintCSS is built on top of Tailwind v3.

## Our Goals

1. High-quality presentation wherever you're reading.

   Whatever we want to show you, we believe that we have only one chance to get you interested in what we have to say.

   You might be on your tablet at home over breakfast, on your smartphone on the commute to the office, on a desktop / laptop during the day, or back on your tablet or smartphone in the evening. If you can't read our website on your first visit, we don't believe that you'll switch devices and try again.

1. Markup that's separated from layout.

   Grids have rightly revolutionised how we layout websites. But all they're doing is filling the gap that was left when we stopped using tables to do the same thing. A grid is markup that describes the layout of your content.

   The right layout for a desktop might be different to what suits reading on a smartphone. In particular, you might want to change the order that your content is displayed in. For example, the kind of navigation that works well in a sidebar on a desktop site often works better displayed below the main content on a mobile site. If you use a grid, there's no easy way to do this, and you often end up maintaining multiple websites.

1. A toolkit to build on.

   Your website needs its own look - its own layout, its own theme. This is far easier to do if you import Ishi into your own collection of SASS rules. This is especially true once you're writing different rules for different target [device groups](concepts/device-groups.html).

   That's why we don't publish ImprintCSS as a simple CSS file for you to include on your webpage.
